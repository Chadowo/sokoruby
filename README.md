# SokoRuby

Sokoban made in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) with [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/)

## Extend

The code's documented nicely (I hope), so you can follow along pretty easily to
create your own.

## Play

Download a zip of the source code here or clone it
`$ git clone https://github.com/Chadowo/sokoruby.git`

after that, if you have already installed gosu
`$ ruby main.rb`
Don't have gosu have installed?, easy as
`$ gem install gosu`

There's also a gemfile if you'd prefer
`$ bundle install`
`$ bundle exec ruby main.rb`

## Features

## Caveats
